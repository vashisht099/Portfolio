# Portfolio: Sukhmanpreet Kaur
Driven by a desire to serve the community, I am committed to using my skills to develop innovative solutions that address real-world 
challenges. I am passionate about leveraging technology to solve complex problems and make a positive impact on society. With a strong 
interest in the field of artificial intelligence, I possess a deep understanding of various machine learning algorithms and techniques, as well a s 
their practical applications. I am constantly expanding my knowledge and skills in various areas, including data preprocessing, data 
visualization, machine learning models, natural language processing (NLP), and computer vision.

## [Project 1: Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Prediction](https://github.com/vashisht099/Polycystic-Ovary-Syndrome-Prediction.git)
- Implemented a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) in women based on a 
variety of physiological and demographic factors.
- Analyzed a large dataset of patient records, identifying key features and patterns that were predictive of PCOS, while taking measures to ensure 
data privacy and security.
- Optimized Logistic, Decision Tree, and Random Forest Classifiers using GridsearchCV to reach the best model.
- Evaluated the performance of the model using various evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, achieving an 
impressive accuracy rate of 88% on the test dataset.
- Created a user-friendly web application that allows clinicians and patients to input relevant data and obtain a personalized prediction of their risk 
for PCOS, using Flask web framework and HTML/CSS for the front-end design.


## [Project 2: Real Estate Price Prediction](https://github.com/vashisht099/Real-Estate-Price-Prediction-Bengaluru.git)
- Developed and implemented a machine learning model to predict the prices of apartments in Bengaluru.
- Utilized cross validation techniques to assess model performance and identify potential overfitting. Also, conducted hyperparameter tuning to 
optimize the model accuracy.
- Optimized Linear, Lasso, and Random Forest Regressors using GridsearchCV to reach the best model.
- Created a user-friendly web application that allows users to input relevant data and obtain a personalized prediction of house prices in Bengaluru, 
using Flask web framework and HTML/CSS for the front-end design.

## [Project 3: HR Analysis](https://github.com/vashisht099/HR-Analysis.git)
- Conducted an independent data analysis project using employee attendance records to gain insights into working preferences and leave-taking 
trends, with the aim of informing critical HR decisions.
- Utilized critical thinking and problem-solving skills to interpret the analysis results, draw conclusions, and propose actionable recommendations 
for optimizing resource allocation and personnel availability planning.
- Communicated the findings and recommendations in a clear and concise manner, leveraging data visualization tools such as Powe r BI to 
present complex data insights effectively.
